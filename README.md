# 14.Combining-Conditions-in-Loops-and-if-else
In Python, conditions can be combined using logical operators (and, or, and not) to create more complex decision-making structures within loops and if-else statements.
# Combining Conditions in Loops and `if-else`

| **Logical Operator** | **Description**                                                                 | **Syntax**                                     | **Example**                                                                                      | **Use Cases**                                                                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`and`**            | Ensures both conditions are `True` for the overall condition to evaluate as `True`. | `if condition1 and condition2:`               | `if x > 5 and x < 10:`<br>`print("x is between 5 and 10")`                                       | - Validating multiple input constraints.<br>- Filtering data based on multiple attributes.       |
| **`or`**             | Ensures the overall condition is `True` if at least one condition is `True`.       | `if condition1 or condition2:`                | `if x < 5 or x > 15:`<br>`print("x is out of range")`                                            | - Checking if a value meets one of several conditions.<br>- Handling flexible criteria.          |
| **`not`**            | Negates the condition, making `True` conditions `False` and vice versa.           | `if not condition:`                            | `if not (x % 2 == 0):`<br>`print("x is odd")`                                                    | - Excluding specific cases.<br>- Reversing logical conditions.                                   |
| **Combined Conditions in Loops** | Use logical operators within loops to iterate and apply multiple conditions.                      | `for variable in iterable:`<br>`if condition:` | `for num in range(10):`<br>`if num > 3 and num < 8:`<br>`print(num)`                             | - Iterating and filtering data dynamically.<br>- Combining conditions for loop-based processing. |
| **Nested Conditions** | Combine conditions in `if-elif-else` for multi-level checks.                    | `if condition1:`<br>`elif condition2:`        | `if x % 2 == 0 and x % 3 == 0:`<br>`print("x divisible by 2 and 3")`<br>`elif x % 2 == 0:`        | - Categorising data into multiple groups.<br>- Implementing stepwise decision-making.            |
